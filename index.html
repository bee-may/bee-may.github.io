            <p>
                On the vanishingly rare chance that you stumbled upon this website without the aid of my resume, I'll say it plainly:
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm looking for a job. And in the most likely case, you've come to this website because you think I could be a good fit for your company, and you want to learn more about me. So while I do have all of the major resume items available here, I've also tried to infuse some of my personality, as well.<br>
                That being said, let's start with a pretty basic point:<br>
                I don't just want <i>a job</i>. I want to find a career; somewhere that I can contribute and grow.<br>
                Earnestness is passe, I know. And yet, I am being perfectly serious about hoping to find a workplace that provides more than a paycheck. I'm a passionate and enthusiastic person, and want to contribute to my community wherever possible. I think the right job will provide just such an opportunity.

            <p>
                <i>November 2016-Present<br>
                    Patent Examiner</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're like everyone else I've spoken to about working at the Patent Office, I'm sure you're thinking something along the lines of but how is that engineering? Don't worry- it's one that I've answered often.<br>
                The really cool thing about being a patent examiner is that you get look at new inventions when they're completed. Conversely, one of the biggest challenges in examining patents is looking at a drawing and determining how and why something works- and whether or not those reasons distinguish the invention over what already exists. Which means that being a patent examiner gives any engineer some pretty unique skills.<br>
                The first skill that Patent Examiners have to learn: how to search for information. There is so much data on the internet, but even with the best search engine in the world, it can still take some effort to find what you need.<br>
                But that's certainly not the only thing I've learned at the Patent Office. For me, I would say my work in patents has enhanced my ability to think outside the box when looking for a solution to a problem. I've seen so many creative solutions through my tenure as a Patent Examiner that I have plenty of inspiration to draw from. It's also helped me learn more about which elements of an invention can be the hallmarks of a good design, and which elements are necessary for engineering utility.

            <p>
                As a graduate researcher, I investigated the possible usefulness of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) in the municipal power industry. This required me to meet with several municipal power companies of different sizes, so that I could determine the potential uses for UAVs. I also researched the legal and business requirements for operating a UAV. Finally, I incorporated my findings into an optimization algorithm to determine when and how a UAV could be used to support municipal power systems.<br>
                In my undergraduate research, I created an improved design for a fluid transfer spike to stop a known problem with the fluid flow. As would be expected, I applied the principles of Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA) to evaluate the use of the transfer spike; isolate the reoccuring failure mode; identify what was successful and unsuccessful in the original design; considered and tested alternatives; and then created a prototype. In the end, the customer's problem was solved, and the new design was accepted.

            <p>
                As the only mechanical engineering intern at RedViking's Raleigh location, I was able to be involved in several engineering projects in all stages of the design and manufacturing process. I worked on the design of one high-speed gearbox and testing of another; the construction, testing, and modification of a precision drilling machine; and assisted in the design of a sensor testing system and its use protocol.

            <p>
                In my second internship at Boeing, I worked as a Design Intern for the Space Lauch System (SLS) Core Stage. I used Creo Pro/E to make and change drawings from parts for the SLS and worked with a team to ensure that all of the drawings met Quality Assurance standards. Our team further collaborated to ensure that all drawings showed the Geometric Deminsioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) necessary for manufacturing.

            <p>
                During my first internship at Boeing, I worked as a Stress Analyst for the International Docking Adapter (IDA) for the International Space Station. I learned to use MSC Patran and Nastran, the software preferred by NASA at that time, and worked with other engineers to produce reports on the structural integrity of designed parts for the IDA.

                Classroom Technician (ClassTech)</i>
                In college, I worked in the Classroom Technology division of my university. I interfaced with professors to ensure that their needs were met, troubleshooting problems and providing solutions to ensure classes were able to proceed when any issues occurred. I also worked with my peers to outfit classrooms with the newest technology and maintain the installed devices.

            <h3>This webpage!</h3>
            <p>
                I did technically have some training on HTML and CSS in college, and was even given an assignment to create my own webpage. But... let's just say the end result was neither interesting nor pretty. However, even out of school, I love learning new things. So, with the help of the internet (Khan Academy and W3Schools in particular), I've managed to learn some of the basics of HTML and CSS. Again, I realize this isn't anything fancy (obviously). But I'm nerdy enough that it's been a fun exploration.

            <h3>Custom Computer Build</h3>
            <p>
                While I've been happily <i>using</i> computers for as long as I can remember, I didn't build one from scratch until I was in graduate school. That machine has been given upgrades over the past few years, but with the new Ryzen processors, I couldn't resist starting from scratch with a new build.<br>
                My new build has a Ryzen 5600X, an MSI GeForce RTX 3060, and several ARGB elements. I can't lie- she's pretty cool. Now that it's complete, I'm definitely looking forward to some gaming in my off hours.

            <h3>On Deck: The Perfect Desk</h3>
            <p>
                The next project I'll be undertaking will be to build a custom desk for my study. The plan is to build use two lengths of maple wood butcher block countertops to create an L-shaped desktop, supported on steel legs and anchored to the wall with structural brackets. The most ambitious part of the project is surprisingly not the 45 degree cuts we have planned for the butcher block, but the task of moving an 11-foot stretch of countertop to the third floor office. Wish me luck!
